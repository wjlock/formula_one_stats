# Formula One Stats
 This web app allows users to look up their favorite drivers, teams, and tracks in Formula One. Results are not limited to just the current season, and actually go all they way back to 1950! Simply use one of the search bars to query for an item, and the app will show you the results along with details pertaining to each item. 

 # How to Use

Using the 'W' and 'S' keys, move your paddle up and down. The person who scores a point 'serves' the next round. Try to apply spin by hitting the ball with your paddle moving. This manipulates the speed of the ball and makes it harder for your opponent to return. The game is played in a best of 7 format, so first to 4 points wins.

Click the "Play" button to get started. If you need to reset the table, click the 'reset' button. The score totals are at the bottom of the page.
